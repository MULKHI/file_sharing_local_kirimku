# file_sharing_local_kirimku
this is my first file sharing project name Kirimku and i used django framework to create it. if you want to be able to use it on the internet, you can use aws s3

activate env at the command prompt by typing "env\Scripts\activate" if it is active then go to the upsharing section and typing "python manage.py runserver" copy the link that will appear and open it in the browser then the local file sharing website can be used.
